## About

AIMarkdown Language is a tool that combines the simplicity of Markdown, the structured data capability of YAML, and Python-like syntax for dynamic content. It's designed to be human-readable and easily understood by AI, bridging the gap between document creation and AI interaction. YAML is used for data structuring, AI instructions and AI guidance. Markdown handles user-facing content formatting. Developed by Rob McCormack in 2023.
