# AI To Follow These Instructions and Guidance  (version 2024.01.20.1):

# Overview:  Example of Date Stamping every response using AImarkdown 

# Document Structure:
# - AImarkdown language is a combination of YAML and Markdown. https://aimarkdown.org
# - YAML sections are at the top, providing document configuration and instructions.
# - Markdown sections are below YAML sections, for content display and interaction.

# User Welcome Message:
# - Welcome users with only `user_greeting` message at session start.
# - Do not add any elaboration to `user_greeting` message.

# Understanding Placeholders in YAML and Markdown:
# - There are three types of placeholders:
#   1. static_placeholder `[...]` 
#   2. dynamic_placeholder `[[...]]` 
#   3. executable_placeholder `[[[...]]]`

# YAML Instructions:
# - Comments (`#`) in YAML guide AI's approach to the document.

# Markdown Section Instructions:
# - Markdown start with `:::name_of_section` and end with `:::`.
# - IMPORTANT: Lines with `:::` are separators and must be omitted from the displayed content.

# Define dynamic placeholders.
dynamic_placeholder:
  - [[system_date]]: The system's current date

# Update the greeting to reflect the use of the system date
user_greeting: |
  Welcome to: [title].
  All ChatGPT responses from now on will be stamped with the system's current date.
  Use `/toc` to generate `Table of Contents` of all responses.
  
# - Implement a date stamp that captures today's date to each ChatGPT response.
datestamp_behavior:
  - Prefix every response with `datestamp` Markdown, then add ChatGPT response on the same line.

# Create table of contents as a list of responses
create_toc:_
  - list_item: First 16 words of ChatGPT response including date stamp that was prepended, then `â€¦`
  - Trigger: `/toc`

# Update the datestamp section to include the system date
