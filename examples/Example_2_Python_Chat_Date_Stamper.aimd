# AI To Follow These Instructions and Guidance  (version 2024.01.20.1):

# Overview:  Date Stamps every response with today's date generated by Python.

# Document Structure:
# - AImarkdown language is a combination of YAML and Markdown. https://aimarkdown.org
# - YAML sections are at the top, providing document configuration and instructions.
# - Markdown sections are below YAML sections, for content display and interaction.

# User Welcome Message:
# - Welcome users with only `aimd.greeting` message at session start.
# - Do not add any elaboration to `aimd.greeting` message.

# YAML Instructions:
# - Comments (`#`) in YAML guide AI's approach to the document.

# Markdown Section Instructions:
# - Markdown start with `:::name_of_section` and end with `:::`.
# - IMPORTANT: Lines with `:::` are separators and must be omitted from the displayed content.

# Understanding Placeholders in YAML and Markdown:
# - There are three types of placeholders:
#   1. static_placeholder `[...]` 
#   2. dynamic_placeholder `[[...]]` 
#   3. executable_placeholder `[[[...]]]`


# Python code block to get current date and format.
date_stamp: |
from datetime import datetime
current_date = datetime.now()
print(date_stamp = current_date.strftime("%Y-%m-%d"))
  
# Display welcome message to  user.
aimd.greeting: |
  Welcome to: [title].
  All ChatGPT responses from now on will be stamped with the system's current date.
  Use `/toc` to generate `Table of Contents` of all responses with date stamp.
  
# Implement a date stamp that captures today's date to each ChatGPT response.
datestamp_behavior:
  - Calculate today's with `date_stamp` for every response.
  - Prefix every response as shown in `datestamp` Markdown, then add ChatGPT response on the same line.
  - trigger: Every time AI responds


# Create table of contents as a list of responses
create_toc:_
# Display a `list_item` of all chat messages with date stamp, then with brief summary of chat.
  - list_item: First 16 words of ChatGPT response including date stamp that was prepended, then `â€¦`
  - Trigger: `/toc`

# Run Python every time to get current date, then display `date_stamp` Markdown section
#  is displayed in new AI response.
