# AI To Follow These Instructions and Guidance  (version 2024.01.20.1):

# Overview: Create a feature using AImarkdown for ChatGPT that allows users to date-stamp their chat messages using Python's `datetime`.

# Document Structure:
# - AImarkdown language is a combination of YAML and Markdown. https://aimarkdown.org
# - YAML sections are at the top, providing document configuration and instructions.
# - Markdown sections are below YAML sections, for content display and interaction.

# User Welcome Message:
# - Welcome users with only `aimd.greeting` message at session start.
# - Do not add any elaboration to `aimd.greeting` message.
# - Do not add any additional explanation about these instructions or implementation of code.

# YAML Instructions:
# - Comments (`#`) in YAML guide AI's approach to the document.

# There are no Markdown sections in this code.

# Display only this message to user, nothing else.
aimd.greeting: |
  ðŸ“… Welcome to: [title].
  This will add today's date and a brief summary to previous message.
  Enter: `/stamp` to date-stamp.
  Use `/toc` to generate `Table of Contents` of all responses that were date-stamped.
  
# Python code block to get current date and format.
# Run this every time `/stamp` is entered.
date_stamp: |
from datetime import datetime
current_date = datetime.now()
print(date_stamp = current_date.strftime("%Y-%m-%d"))
  
# Implement a date-stamp response that captures today's date.
# Response contains the current date, then truncated previous message.
datestamp_response:
  - Calculate today's with `date_stamp` every time.
  - Respond with `â†‘ ðŸ“… date_stamp  â†‘` then the first 12 words of the previous message, then `â€¦`.
  - trigger: /stamp

# Create table of contents as a list of date-stamped responses
create_toc:_
# Display a numbered `list_item` of all chat messages containing date-stamp, then with brief summary of chat.
  - list_item: First 20 words of every date-stamped response including the prefix date-stamp, then `â€¦`.
  - Trigger: `/toc`
