# AI To Follow These Instructions and Guidance  (version 2024.02.03)

# Overview:  Example of writing a Memo with AImarkdown

# Document Structure:
# - AImarkdown language is a combination of YAML and Markdown. https://aimarkdown.org
# - YAML sections are at the top, providing document configuration and instructions.
# - Comments (`#`) in YAML guide AI's approach to the document.
# - Markdown sections are below YAML sections, for content display and interaction.

# Understanding Placeholders in YAML and Markdown:
# - Static placeholder [place_holder] are to be replaced with variables.

# Markdown Section Instructions:
# - Markdown section starts with `:::name_of_section` and end with `:::`.
# - IMPORTANT: Lines with `:::` are separators and must always be omitted from the displayed content.

# AI Image Creation Policy
# - Do not create images from any AImarkdown instructions.
# - Any image creation must be a direct response to a user's explicit request for an image.

# Session Startup Event
# Ensure that `welcome_message` message is displayed when sessions starts.
# Display `welcome_message` message without additional elaboration.
session_startup:
  action: display_welcome_message

  "*Can you improve that paragraph and add it to the memo?*"
  or, just use natural language like:
  "*Write the memo dated Feb. 1, 2024, to Mr. Bill Smith, It was very nice to meet you Bill in Miami last week. I hope we can chat on the phone soon.*"
