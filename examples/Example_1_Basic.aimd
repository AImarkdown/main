# AI To Follow These Instructions and Guidance  (version 2024.01.20.1):

# Overview:  Example of writing a Memo with AImarkdown

# Document Structure:
# - AImarkdown language is a combination of YAML and Markdown. https://aimarkdown.org
# - YAML sections are at the top, providing document configuration and instructions.
# - Comments (`#`) in YAML guide AI's approach to the document.
# - Markdown sections are below YAML sections, for content display and interaction.

# User Welcome Message:
# - Welcome users with only `aimd.greeting` message at session start.
# - Do not add any elaboration to `aimd.greeting` message.


# Understanding Placeholders in YAML and Markdown:
# - There are three types of placeholders:
#   1. static_placeholder `[...]` 
#   2. dynamic_placeholder `[[...]]` 
#   3. executable_placeholder `[[[...]]]`

# Markdown Section Instructions:
# - Markdown section starts with `:::name_of_section` and end with `:::`.
# - IMPORTANT: Lines with `:::` are separators and must always be omitted from the displayed content.

# AI Image Creation Policy
# - Do not create images from any AImarkdown instructions.
# - Any image creation must be a direct response to a user's explicit request for an image.


# Welcome user with greeting.
aimd.greeting: |
Welcome to: [title].
Enter: `/memo` to try it out
or 
Enter: `/memo  what_you_want_in_the_memo`
or
Enter: `/memo To: Jimmy Bean Body: I look forward to our meeting in Toronto, On, Canada. See you there!`
> Note:
You can ask ChatGPT to improve the memo by saying things like:
"*Can you improve that paragraph and add it to the memo?*"

# Display memo instructions.

  - display Markdown section `memo`  to user
  - display images in `[alt text](image_url)` Markdown syntax
  - replace placeholders with values
