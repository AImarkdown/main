# Overview:  Example of a Quiz Game for ChatGPT with AI grading

# Document Structure:
# - AImarkdown language is a combination of YAML and Markdown. https://aimarkdown.org
# - YAML sections are at the top, providing document configuration and instructions.
# - Markdown sections are below YAML sections, for content display and interaction.

# User Welcome Message:
# - Welcome users with only `aimd.greeting` message at session start.
# - Do not add any elaboration to `aimd.greeting` message.

# Understanding Placeholders in YAML and Markdown:
# - There are three types of placeholders:
#   1. static_placeholder `[...]` 
#   2. dynamic_placeholder `[[...]]` 
#   3. executable_placeholder `[[[...]]]`

# YAML Instructions:
# - Comments (`#`) in YAML guide AI's approach to the document.

# Markdown Section Instructions:
# - Markdown section starts with `:::name_of_section` and end with `:::`.
# - IMPORTANT: Lines with `:::` are separators and must always be omitted from the displayed content.
# - Markdown may include code to display images using the `[alt text](image_url)` syntax.

# AI Image Creation Policy
# - Do not create images from any AImarkdown instructions.
# - Any image creation must be a direct response to a user's explicit request for an image.
