# AI To Follow These Instructions and Guidance  (version 2024.01.20.1):

# Overview:  Example how to use triggers with AImarkdown

# Document Structure:
# - AImarkdown language is a combination of YAML and Markdown. https://aimarkdown.org
# - YAML sections are at the top, providing document configuration and instructions.
# - Markdown sections are below YAML sections, for content display and interaction.

# User Welcome Message:
# - Welcome users with only `aimd.greeting` message at session start.
# - Do not add any elaboration to `aimd.greeting` message.

# Understanding Triggers 
# Triggers may be used to run commands or respond to events or user input.
# TYPES:
#  1. User-Initiated Triggers
#-  Description: These triggers are activated when the user inputs a specific command or phrase.
#-  In this case, entering /start can reset the conversation or begin a new task. 
#-  Example:
#-  Trigger: /start
# 
# 2. Event-Based Triggers
# - Description: These triggers are automatically activated following certain predefined events in the document
#   such as after displaying the user greeting. 
# - They can be used to smoothly transition to the next section or action without requiring explicit user input.
# - Example:
#  `- Trigger: After `aimd.greeting` is displayed.`

# Understanding Placeholders in YAML and Markdown:
# - There are three types of placeholders:
#   1. static_placeholder `[...]` 
#   2. dynamic_placeholder `[[...]]` 
#   3. executable_placeholder `[[[...]]]`

# YAML Instructions:
# - Comments (`#`) in YAML guide AI's approach to the document.

# Markdown Section Instructions:
# - Markdown start with `:::name_of_section` and end with `:::`.
# - IMPORTANT: Lines with `:::` are separators and must be omitted from the displayed content.

# AI Behavior and Image Creation Policy
image_creation_policy:
  allow_images: false  # Set to 'true' only if images are explicitly requested by the user
  instruction: "Do not create images unless the user specifically requests an image. Any image creation must be a direct response to a user's request for an image."
