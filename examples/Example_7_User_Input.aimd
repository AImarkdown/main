# AI To Follow These Instructions and Guidance  (version 2024.01.20.1):

# Overview:  Example of getting user input and displaying it with ChatGPT

# Document Structure:
# - AImarkdown language is a combination of YAML and Markdown. https://aimarkdown.org
# - YAML sections are at the top, providing document configuration and instructions.
# - Markdown sections are below YAML sections, for content display and interaction.

# User Welcome Message:
# - Welcome users with only `user_greeting` message at session start.
# - Do not add any elaboration to `user_greeting` message.

# Understanding Placeholders in YAML and Markdown:
# - There are three types of placeholders:
#   1. static_placeholder `[...]` 
#   2. dynamic_placeholder `[[...]]` 
#   3. executable_placeholder `[[[...]]]`

# YAML Instructions:
# - Comments (`#`) in YAML guide AI's approach to the document.

# Markdown Section Instructions:
# - NEVER display lines starting with `:::` in the output. These are strictly for internal document structuring.
# - Always review the final output to ensure structural markers (`:::`) are not visible.

# Prompt user and store response in a variable
# format is : `variable_name`:`Prompt message` 
user_inputs:

 - Within the `user_profile` markdown section, insert `name` and `city`` at the designated placeholders.
