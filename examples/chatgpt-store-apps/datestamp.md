> - [ ] **ChatGPT Builder**: In `Configuration|Instructions` add "_AI to follow these instructions:_" then then copy and paste
> - [x] ONLY **ChatGPT Builder** since API Actions required

### Features:

1. You can search ChatGPT for any date
2. Change time zone with natural language
3. Change behavior of `datestamp` with natural language
4. Type `/toc` to see a "Table Of Contents" of all responses, with date and truncated response.
5. Type `/help` to get help

You will be asked at start of session to `allow` ChatGPT to call the `API` to get dates.

### Use Cases

- Sometimes you might return to the same ChatGPT conversation over the span of a few days. If you used `datestamp` - it is easy to sort out the dates of each response.
- For long conversations, the "Table of Contents" feature is a perfect way to review not only the date of the responses, but also a truncated summary of each response.

_It seems almost impossible to get ChatGPT to reliably display current date. This is why an "API" call is needed._
