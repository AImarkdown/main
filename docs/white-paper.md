### AIMarkdown White Paper

> Jan 28, 2024, by Rob McCormack

### Summary

AImarkdown Language is an innovative new tool for ChatGPT and ChatGPT Builder, targeting mainly non-programmers. It democratizes the building of AI apps and interactions, akin to how spreadsheets revolutionized data manipulation. AImarkdown's goal is to achieve native ChatGPT support, significantly reducing coding requirements. For example, an existing AImarkdown example app of 50 lines, could reduced to 15 lines with native ChatGPT support.

### Introduction

AImarkdown, combining and extending YAML and Markdown languages, is a streamlined tool for AI programming and content presentation. It is simple, accessible, and intuitive, catering to both non-programmers and programmers, with capabilities for embedding Python and JavaScript.

### Genesis

AImarkdown was born from recognizing a gap in ChatGPT 4 and ChatGPT Builder. While AI handles natural language effectively, a more structured and dependable approach was needed for creating apps, custom prompts, and behaviors. Interestingly, AImarkdown originated somewhat accidentally. While attempting to build iPhone apps with ChatGPT's assistance, Rob McCormack realized that with added structure and a customized chat-based interface, ChatGPT could be ideal for app development, without needing a classic programming language. AImarkdown-based apps can be developed rapidly and are error-tolerant, as AI manages error detection and automatic code correction. This marked a new paradigm in programming and app development.

Surprisingly, much of the motivation for AImarkdown development stemmed from ChatGPT itself. In the early stages, ChatGPT offered such positive feedback on AImarkdown, providing encouragement, insight, and suggestions for further development.

### Innovation Process

1. Identify a problem.
2. Conceptualize a solution using existing possibilities.
3. Refine the concept into a practical solution.
4. Transform it into a standard industry product.
