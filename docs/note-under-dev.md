AImarkdown Script is under development and is not currently supported by ChatGPT 4. To use it effectively, be prepared to provide clear instructions and explanations to ChatGPT. Consider having ChatGPT generate YAML instructions for easier use. Expect several iterations to fine-tune your AImarkdown apps.

_Future native support would greatly enhance AImarkdown Script._
