## Overview
This guide provides best practices for using backticks (` ` `), single quotes (`'`), and double quotes (`"`) in AIMarkdown, with examples for clarity.

## 1. Backticks (` ` `)
- **Use Case**: For inline code, command names, file paths, or technical terms.
- **Best Practice**: Enclose text that should be displayed in a monospaced font.

  ```
  `variable_name`
  `./path/to/file`
  ```

## 2. Single Quotes (`'`)
- **Use Case**: For simple string literals or literal characters.
- **Best Practice**: Use for strings to be interpreted literally, without special characters.
- **Example**: 
  ```yaml
  user_greeting: 'Welcome to Chat BookMarker'
  ```

## 3. Double Quotes (`"`)
- **Use Case**: For string literals with special characters or formatting.
- **Best Practice**: Use when strings contain special characters or require escape sequences.
- **Example**: 
  ```yaml
  error_message: "Line 10: Unexpected character found."
  ```
